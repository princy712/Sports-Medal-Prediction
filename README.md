🏅 Olympic Medal Prediction
This project leverages machine learning to predict Olympic medal winners based on historical data. By analyzing past performances, country-wise trends, and athlete statistics, the model forecasts potential medalists.

📌 Project Overview
The Olympic Medal Prediction project uses data science and machine learning to analyze past Olympic results and predict which countries or athletes are likely to win medals in future games. The dataset includes historical Olympic data, featuring variables like country, athlete performance, event type, and previous medal counts.

🚀 Features
✅ Data Collection & Preprocessing – Handling Olympic data for accurate predictions.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualizing key trends and patterns in Olympic history.
✅ Feature Engineering – Selecting important variables influencing medal wins.
✅ Model Training & Evaluation – Using ML algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or XGBoost for predictions.
✅ Performance Metrics – Evaluating model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score.
